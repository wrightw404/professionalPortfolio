# professionalPortfolio
The acceptance crtiteria for this module was 

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

There was a lot of learning that went on during the module, alot of youtube, stackoverflow, etc. There is one thing I am struggling with and that is css flex box and positioning. There will be times where I think I get it but then times where I feel the exact opposite. In my code I did encounter a problem where my second container (aboutme) was extending all the way to the top of my page. However, none of my other containers had that problem and I tried my best to copy and paste from those containers to see what the problem was but I couldn't figure it out. So now that container is not responsive to re-sizing down. I would like to still work on it for the possibility of a re-grade, because I think I can get it. Aside from that struggle I really enjoyed the process of starting from scratch, I think it makes learning the process easier because hands on from start to finish. I also mis-interpreted the critieria point where the first application is supposed to be larger. I took that as when you hover over the application it becomes bigger than the other ones. So that is something else I could turn in for a re-grade. Overall, I am pleased with the way it turned out.
