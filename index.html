	            <p> I am a senior at Michigan State Univeristy studying <a href="http://www.cal.msu.edu/academics/undergraduate/xa" target="_blank">Experience Architecture</a>. My first experiences with web design and development were in high school when I took both web design and computer science classes. Ever since then I was hooked. The ability to help people through web design is something that I think is often overlooked and is something that I want to make a point of in my professional career. You can look at some of my accessibility work in my my <a href="#test">projects section</a>. <br> I have been fortunate in life to be able to travel many different places and experience other cultures. I believe these past experiences have made me a well-rounded individual who accepts and celebrates all walks of life. However, as great as many of those times were there were always times where I was reminded to be grateful for what I have and in those times I think ones true self is really brought out. In my case it brought out my desire to help people. Many of the rewards I have gained by traveling I owe to my Mom. This December marks the one year anniversary of her moving to Honduras. While down there she became friends with a man in the tourism industry. He often complained about his companies lack of presence online. My Mom and myself recommended hiring a professional web developer to create his site. After the creation of his website his company hit record high numbers during tourist season, which quite frankly changed his life. Seeing the power that technology can have on the well being of a family is what really cemented my desires. </p>
